So, you are just going to tell me which 2 chapters you completed from among all the choices in this list of courses.  Do this by filling in the Course/Chapter title in the cell below.  Scroll through the course outlines first to see which ones look the most interesting/useful to you.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Read in a sample of SDSS imaging data.  Print out the feature names, and create a data matrix out of a subset of features (at least 10, but otherwise your choice [but don't choose `type` or `run`]).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use PCA (with randomized svd_solver for speed) to reduce the data matrix down to $2$ features. What is the explained variance of the data encapsulated in these eigen-features?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Access the `type` key of the `data` structure and make an array of labels out of these. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make a scatter plot of the PCA-reduced data for these $5000$ random samples, colored by their corresponding `type`. *(You may want to set the transparency to be lower than 1 to see the mixing of samples.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Choose $5000$ random integers between 0 and the number of samples in the data matrix. Record these integers because you'll use them later. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Now try some non-linear dimensional reduction. These algorithms are slower than PCA, so you will operate only on the $5000$ random samples identified in the previous part. \n",
    "   - Try `LocallyLinearEmbedding`, `Isomap`, and `TSNE` algorithms, setting the number of components to be $2$ in all cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. As in the PCA case, make scatter plots of the dimensionally-reduced data, color coded by their `type`. For LLE and Isomap, experiment with the number of nearest neighbors between $5$ and $100$ to see what visually gives the best separation in `type` populations. For TSNE, do the same for the perplexity attribute. \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Which algorithm gives the cleanest way to visually see the two populations of sources? *(This will be subjective according to the samples you trained on, and even the randomness of the algorithms.)*"
